# Wavelet Trees

## Level-wise wavelet tree — balanced binary tree supporting rank/select/access in O(log σ)
## Huffman-shaped wavelet tree — height proportional to −log p(c); reduces average query time
## Wavelet matrix — pointer-free variant that rearranges bits per level
## **RRR compressed bit-vector rank/select** — entropy-bounded bit-vector with O(1) ops
## rank(c, i) on wavelet tree — counts c up to i
## select(c, k) on wavelet tree — position of k-th c
## access(i) on wavelet tree — symbol at position i
